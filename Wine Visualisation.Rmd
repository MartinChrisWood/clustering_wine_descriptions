## What data?  Exploration

We have a bunch of data, what's it like?

```{r loading}
# Load the previously assigned topic distributions
topics <- read.csv("doc_topic_distributions.csv")

# Load the original metadata on wines
wine_df <- read.csv("./data/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv")

# Merge the two, drop the original frames to save memory (tiny laptop!)
dat <- merge(topics, wine_df, by="title")
drop(topics)
drop(wine_df)
```

## Plot the topic space (SOM's)


## Plot the source (World map!)
